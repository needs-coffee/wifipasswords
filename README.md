![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wifipasswords) ![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/needs-coffee/wifipasswords?include_prereleases) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/needs-coffee/wifipasswords) ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/wifipasswords) [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/wifipasswords)](https://pepy.tech/project/wifipasswords)

Retrieve and save all WiFi networks and passwords on the device.  
On windows uses the netsh subprocess.  
On linux reads the NetworkManager files or wpa_supplicant.conf.  

Cross platform:
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS (working - however see below note)

there is also a GUI version of this tool that can be found here - [WifiPasswords-GUI](https://github.com/needs-coffee/wifipasswords-GUI)

**NOTE:** requires sudo privileges on linux only if NetworkManager is not used.  

**NOTE:** Macos requires admin authentication for each password read, this can result in a lot of prompts for the get_passwords() function. I am currently looking for a solution for this.

Features
--------

Installation
------------
Installed via pip using: ``pip install wifipasswords``

Usage
-----
```python
from wifipasswords import WifiPasswords

passwords = WifiPasswords().get_passwords()
connected_passwords = WifiPasswords().get_currently_connected_passwords()

print(passwords)
print(connected_passwords)

WifiPasswords().save_wpa_supplicant('.', passwords, True, 'GB')
```

Command Line Usage
------------------

![example output](docs/command_line_example.png "Example Command Line Output")


To see command line options run ``wifipasswords -h``

Packaging as EXE
----------------
Can be packaged to an EXE on windows with:  
``pyinstaller --clean --noconsole --onefile -i <icon> wifipasswords_exe.py``

The wifipasswords_exe.py file is the same as the __main__.py file in the package except will pause after console output is finished to prevent the terminal from auto-closing if the EXE is run directly.


Testing
-------
Test locally with `pytest -v ./tests`
Currently github test runners do not have nmcli interface to access wifi data so test locally.
